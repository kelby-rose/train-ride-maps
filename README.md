## How it works

The webapp embeds a YouTube video, and overlays an OpenStreetMap map view over it. If there is timing & location data for the video, the map shows the train's location synchronized with video playback.

Note that timing & location data must be entered manually with this webapp; this data is not extracted automatically from the video.
